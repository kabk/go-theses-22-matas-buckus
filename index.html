          <div class="bodytext1">
            <p>Around two years ago, after some time  spent on studying and researching what this wide term of “graphic design” possibly means, I found myself being able to access so much content especially through newly available and ever expanding digital manners. I found myself scrolling the endless streams of images generated by algorithms, made accessible through social media, an addiction of “keeping up” and a fear of “missing out”. This immense saturation of curated imagery I experienced in my daily life, in the academy, at home and outside took a toll on my studying process and overall interest in this subject. Being in this mind-set of “everything has been done already” pushed me to take a lengthier break from certain ways of consuming visuals, particularly through digital medias. </p>
</div>
<div class="bodytext1">
<p>Are the possible aspects of the outside world which we overlook in our daily, busy lives? An interest in the visual aspects of the physical space that we all experience started to show itself. Could it possibly be that all these minimal, clear, instructive signages reflect certain aspects of our society today? What can be concluded about the states thirst for authority from numerous signs in public? An excessive attempt to control and regulate public life, traffic and other aspects? </p>
</div>
<div class="bodytext1">
<p>Public signage ages and gets transformed by factors such as rain, strong winds, fluctuating temperatures, natural reactions, falling objects, animals, humans, and multiple types of vehicles that are utilized by humans. In this thesis, I will investigate “modern” capitalistic society and its cityscapes, showing that these are closely intertwined with what we are exposed to visually in the public space. By analyzing the beginnings and objectives of signage I turn to theories of perception, behavior, semiotics amongst others. The categories of signs differ between commercial and informative types of signage, between the physical, tactile and newly conceived digital public space. In case studies I study the above mentioned as well as regulations, the bureaucratic and formal aspects of state and company owned signage but also various artistic approaches. </p>

  <!-- <div class="bodytext"> -->

  <div class="bodytext2" id="heading">
    <p id="bold"> ↳ Way-finding</p>
</div>
  <div class="bodytext2">
    <p> Wake up, get ready, eat, work, rest and repeat. We humans naturally mold ourselves into daily routines to create consistency and slowly achieve our goals. All of us have our own values, objectives and beliefs, which we embody through our way of thinking, speaking, dressing. Our homes are a safe space where which we can adapt to fit our needs and wants. However, throughout our life we visit uncountable destinations. To get to these places we commute though the so called public space. Nowadays the public space is somewhat of a visual war-zone, an abundance of un-familiar faces, advertisements, modern and traditional constructions and authoritative signs, communicating how, what or why we should behave in certain manners.  Instructions where to walk, where to stand, where to stop, where not to walk, where not to stand, where not to stop. Signals, traffic lights, analog, or neon posters, advertisements and blinking lights. A mixture of sign languages and symbols creating an urban forest. Graphic design is used aggressively, to convince, directing your attention, informing your behavior, and maintaining authority. </p>
</div>
<div class="bodytext2">
<p>Firstly, we look back on how humans oriented themselves through a “wild” planet earth, and why finding your way around your environment was an essential part of life. In his book “Wayfinding”, Michael Bond states: <p1>”The physical world is infinitely complex, yet most of us are able to find our way around it. We can walk through unfamiliar streets while maintaining a sense of direction, take shortcuts along paths we have never used and remember for many years places we have visited only once”[O].</p1> The public space leaves a significant imprint on the human mind. We unconsciously map out places we visit, our brain marks these like little landmarks, remembering certain factors more than others, but spatial familiarity is a large part of our lives. Looking back to the times before urbanization, certain features of landscapes or landmarks helped us to navigate and understand where we are geographically situated, and what paths to take to get to a destination. To understand the current situation of the public space and if what we are visually exposed to today is excessive, we look back at the stone age also known as the Palaeolithic age, Bond writes: <p1>”You had to be able to walk for days over ground you may not have seem before ,a cross prairie, through woods and over mountains, to forage, hunt or sit around a fire with distant neighbors. And at every point in your journeying you had to know the way home, because those who didn’t make it back usually perished. Other spatial attributes would have helped, too: a mental map, for instance, to remember where to find food and medicinal plants and important features such as bear caves, streams and shelter. Getting lost was potentially catastrophic. The European countryside of that era was a lot more exotic than it is today: in the underwood lurked cave lions, brown bears, leopards, spotted hyenas, wolves and sabre-toothed cats, and there weren’t many fellow humans around to show you the way”[O].</p1>  </p>
</div>

<div class="bodytext2">
<p>With no signs or navigation technology to lead the way, humans had to find other means of understanding space. Being on foot also meant that if you got lost after sun set you would be exposed to many dangers, ultimately risking your life. Remembering your direction and path and way back home was crucial for survival.  </p>
</div>

<div class="bodytext2">
<p>Another aspect that was different in the “old stone age” was language. The ways of communicating could only be based on bodily expression such speech and body language, there were no ways of expressing knowledge through crafted or designed means to which we are so used to today. Humans communicated about significant geographical features in order to help each other hunt for food or plants more efficiently: <p1> “Very likely, humans have been defining and expressing features of the landscape for as long as language has existed. In fact, some scientists believe that language may have evolved for this very reason: to allow humans to share information about their environment”[O].</p1> In todays world, especially in urban areas, it is hard to pay attention to geographical differences and landmarks due to the saturation of visual material that we see. Some of this content is designed to lead us on our way, however most of it has different purposes or persuasion, distraction and increasing profit. Does this visual overload helps us to stay focused and navigate to our intended destinations, or does it rather inflict a feeling of cognitive dissonance? </p>
